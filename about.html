      This place is beyond amazing! Outstanding customer service. I had a terrible time with insurance and Roger had my back the whole time and was willing to talk with insurance and do anything for me so that I could keep my car and repair it. Just picked it up today and it looks beautiful! All oem parts. Paint looks prestine. Gaps between panels are perfect. They even put the aftermarket black piece on the bottom of the front bumper for me and painted my side mirrors black like I wanted. Would definitely recommend this place.

      Absolutely wonderful people to work with! They made a stressful situation not stressful at all! They handled everything from the rental car to the insurance headaches of getting the bill taken care of and they did amazing work on my truck! Looks brand new again! All while uploading photos and sending me the pictures every step of the way so I knew where there where on my truck each step! 10/10 recommend and would never go anywhere else!

      The staff is professional and courteous.   They helped me get a repair quote to my insurance company. Unfortunately my vehicle was beyond repair, the crew at basin helped me retrieve personal items from the truck.

      Attentive and very friendly staff. Great communication and great customer service. Everything was communicated at the time that information was received even when the total cost of repair was deemed higher than book. Thank you Dean for everything.

      I had an excellent experience.  The repair was completed sooner than promised.  The work was professional and very high quality.  They worked with the insurance company and made that process go smoothly.  They even cleaned the inside of my truck.  I would definitely use them again.

      Absolutely the best body shop in the basin,
      They fixed our baby (2015 Mustang) after someone carelessly hit it in a parking lot
      And restored it to it's prior beauty, in fact I think it looks better and it was flawless before so go figure that.  They used a full body panel instead of using any body filler which I really appreciate. They kept us informed of the progress with a web link to the pictures of the whole process.
      Simply the best
